Abstract

   People keep pitching drafts to the TLS Working Group where the only
   thing the draft does is register a code point for a cryptographic
   algorithm.  Stop doing that.  It's unnecessary.  Write an email to
   IANA instead.

1.  Introduction

   There used to be a grand tradition of debating the merits of
   cryptographic algorithms in the TLS working group.  Over time, folks
   realized that this was not a productive use of the WG's time.  The
   typical TLS WG participant is not a cryptographer, and the
   cryptographic choices of TLS users are typically dictated by other
   factors than the opinion of the TLS WG.

   As a result, [RFC8447] loosened the registration policy on the TLS
   registries to Specification Required, with a very limited carve-outs
   related to the "Recommended" column.  As a result, anyone can
   register a code point for a cryptographic algorithm with a stable
   public specification, without having to convince the TLS WG of
   anything.  Registration is as simple as one email to iana@iana.org
   (mailto:iana@iana.org).

   This document proposes that the TLS WG adopt a restrictive policy
   that if the only thing a document does could be done without the WG,
   that document will not be adopted.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  When Are Crypto Documents OK?

   The registry policies in [RFC8447] define a few specific things that
   require working group action.

   *  Initial registration with Recommended=Y

   *  Changing the value of the Recommended column to "Y" or "D" from
      something else

   *  Changing the value of the Recommended column from "Y" or "D" to
      something else

   Unless a document does one of these things it MUST NOT be adopted by
   the WG.  Even if there are additional technical details to be
   specified, the proponents can publish their own specification; even
   an individual -00 Internet-draft meets IANA's criteria for a stable,
   public specification.

   For example:

   *  [I-D.ietf-tls-mlkem] and [I-D.ietf-tls-mldsa] define technical
      details, but do not request Recommended=Y.  The authors could have
      simply published these details on their own (e.g., in an
      individual Internet-draft) and requested code points.

   *  [I-D.reddy-tls-slhdsa] simply registers SLH-DSA code points,
      pointing to the existing FIPS documents for all technical details.
      Nonetheless, it has consumed a significant amount of WG time,
      including multiple challenges and appeals.

   Authors that just want to register a code point should skip the
   working group and go directly to IANA.  It's easier, it's faster, and
   it won't waste a bunch of other folks' time in the working group.

4.  Security Considerations

   The policy proposed in this document has no impact on security.  The
   registry policies already allow any algorithm with a specification to
   be registered.  Let's just not spend the WG's time debating things
   that the WG doesn't need to opine on.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.  Ironically.
